Official database for the Hellfire (Looking4Group) project.

__**Installation:**__

Either run all the sql files in the world folder (can be easily done with HeidiSQL for example), or use the full_world.sql file.
If you choose to use the full_world.sql file, you also need to run worldboss_respawn.sql separately (found in world folder)
